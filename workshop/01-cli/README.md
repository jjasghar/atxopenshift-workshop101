# Using the CLI in a Terminal

There are couple ways in which you can set up your environment and work on your desktop/laptop, or in the Web Shell. The goal is to make a terminal window connected to Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

## The Web Shell environment

You might prefer to use a predefined environment in a terminal available over web browser. If that is a case use the following link:

â€‹https://shell.cloud.ibm.com

![Click the Login in the upper right](../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot_from_2020-02-10_12-27-52.png)

or you can use the IBM Cloud Console

![Click the > icon by the 1840867 account name](../gitbook/assets/Screenshot_from_2020-02-10_12-27-52.png)

You should see a terminal and an empty screen when you open your web shell.

Please point your terminal environment to the IBM org

Point your environment to IBM org as it is shown on the screenshot (the arrow no 1 first to get the IBM org, then arrow no 2 to start the terminal).
Your local Terminal

{% hint style="warn" %}
Alternatively you might be using your own terminal.

In such a case please make sure to install docker locally using Docker Desktop.
{% endhint %}
